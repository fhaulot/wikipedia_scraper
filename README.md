# Wikipedia Leaders Scraper
3rd project with Becode

The purpose of this project is to connect to an API and get differents bios of political leaders from different countries. 
The project is still in progress but I hope to finish it really soon! It misses a link with the first paragraph of each page.

# Installation

This project uses Python and librairies. Get sure to have 'lxml', 'BeautifulSoup' and 'Requests'.

# Usage

While running the main.py file, a json document will appear with bio about the leaders. It still need to get the first paragraph of each wikipedia page to be attached.
